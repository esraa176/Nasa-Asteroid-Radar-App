Asteroid Radar is an app to view the asteroids detected by NASA that pass near Earth, you can view all the detected asteroids in a period of time, their data (Size, velocity, distance to Earth) and if they are potentially hazardous.

The app consists of two screens: A Main screen with a list of all the detected asteroids and a Details screen that displays the data of that asteroid once it´s selected in the Main screen list. The main screen also shows the NASA image of the day to make the app more striking.
 
 
The application:
