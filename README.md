# Nasa Asteroid Radar App

Asteroid Radar is an app to view the asteroids detected by NASA that pass near Earth, you can view all the detected asteroids in a period of time, their data (Size, velocity, distance to Earth) and if they are potentially hazardous.

The app consists of two screens: A Main screen with a list of all the detected asteroids and a Details screen that displays the data of that asteroid once it´s selected in the Main screen list. The main screen also shows the NASA image of the day to make the app more striking.
 
 
The application:
- Includes the Main screen with a list of clickable asteroids
- Includes a Details screen that displays the selected asteroid data once it’s clicked in the Main screen
- Downloads and parses data from the NASA NeoWS (Near Earth Object Web Service) API.
- Once an asteroid is saved in the database, the list of asteroids is displayed
- The asteroids data is cached by using a worker, so it downloads and saves week asteroids in background when device is charging and wifi is enabled, as well as deleted the asteroids data of the previous day
- App works in multiple screen sizes and orientations, also it provides talk back and push button navigation.
